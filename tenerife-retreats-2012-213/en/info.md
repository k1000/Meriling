###Longsal Longde Retreat
**23 - 29, November 2012**

Dzogchen Longde was transmitted by Garab Dorje but the original root text is the tantra called Longchen Rabjam Gyalpoi Gyüd (The King of the Infinite Universe). Another famous text is the tantra called Namkha Tang Nyampai Gyüd (Equal to Space). These root tantras were transmitted by the master Ngöndzog Gyalpo in his nirmanakaya manifestation about 5000 years before Buddha Shakyamuni. Naturally, during Buddha Shakyamuni's time the teaching was no longer around but only what is called the nyengyüd in tibetan, which means an oral teaching made up of only a few words. "

*Chögyal Namkhai Norbu - Longde Teachings  -  Namgyalgar, 1997*

Longde is one of the Three Series of Dzogchen Teachings into which Mañjushrimitra divided the teachings of Garab Dorje. Of the three series, Longde is the intermediate one  -  not as abrupt and rapid as the Menngagde (Upadeshavarga), not as seemingly gradual and less rapid as the Semde. 

This particular teaching is part of the Longsal series of terma or treasure teachings revealed by the Tertön or Revealer Chögyal Namkhai Norbu. It is rather rare that Longde teachings are revealed as Termas, for nearly all Terma Dzogchen Teachings belong to the Menngagde.

###Chöd Retreat - teachings & practice
*7 - 13, December 2012*

The practice of Chöd is very widespread in Tibet, not only in the Dzogchen teachings but in all schools of Buddhism, as well as in the Bönpo tradition. Its origins can be traced principally to the female master Machig Labdrön, a manifestation of Vajrayogini. The Chöd practice came into being as the essence of all the teachings she had received but, above all, it derived directly from her own experience and knowledge. This way she realized that at the root of all our problems is the ego, because it is the ego which limits us. So the principle of Chöd is liberating ourselves from the condition of nyem, the ego.

###Guru Dragphur - teachings & practice
*26 December 2012 - 1 January 2013*

The main purpose for practising the various manifestations of the Sambhogakaya is to obtain total realization or the real knowledge of one’s potentiality through the experience of clarity.

The Practice of Guru Tragphur can also be very useful at the relative level of our existence, which is a condition of great confusion full of problems and many negative provocations that we receive from other beings. This practice includes many secondary functions to deal with such provocations.

###Chüdlen of Mandarava Retreat
*15 - 25 Feburary, 2013*
 
The title of this teaching is Chimed Khandro Sogthig  -  The Heart Thigle of the Dakini of Immortality.

The Chüdlen we are doing is connected to a Long Life Practice. In general, Long Life Practice is useful for strenghtening one’s protective energy. This is importante in all senses. To be able to have some realization through certain practices, first of all one needs to be healthy and free from physical problems. Even if you are not dedicating yourself only to the practice you need to live well in daily life and you only live well when you do not have problems, that is, when your energy is perfect and especially when your protective energy is healthy. If your energy has some weak points it needs to be reinforced, so we have to know how to do that. This is one of the principles of the Long Life Practice. Many people think that the Long Life Practice is a kind of prayer, just to receive a kind of blessing, but it’s not like that. This practice means working with oneself, using visualization, mantras and Chüdlen pills.
